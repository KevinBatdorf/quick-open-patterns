This plugin could very well become obsolete if similiar (and more reliable) functionality is merged into core. Because of that, this wont be published to w.org and it has auto updates disabled

To install, press green "Code" button at the top of this repository then press "Download Zip." That's the file you upload to your site. After installed, be sure to activate it.
